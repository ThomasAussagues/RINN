# Improved_RINN -- Implementation of paper RUNGE-KUTTA Schemes for Joint Identificationand Integration of Stiff Systems.

In  this  work,  we  focus  on  the  joint  identification and  integration  of  dynamical  systems  using  a  residual  neuralnetwork.  We  propose  a  framework  that  learns  simultaneouslythe  RUNGE-KUTTA  coefficients  of  the  integration  scheme  and the parameters of the dynamical operator. We test the proposed         architecture  on  several  examples  including  stiff  systems.
